# Euler-Circuit
This project can find Euler circuit from given vertices and number of Edges betweeen them.

1. First all files are comiled.
2. Run Test.java
3. It runs several test cases and ask for custom input.

Example

In this case 3 is the given value, let A, B, C be those vertices. The following input related to rows in the adjacency matrix of edges between those points. Below is the example.
 | A | B | C
A| 1 | 0 | 2
B| 0 | 2 | 1
C| 2 | 1 | 1
Which means there are only 2 edges between A and C whereas 0 from A to B, etc. 

4. If a Euler circuit exists, program will output it.
